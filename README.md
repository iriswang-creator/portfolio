## Themes

- **Responsible AI architecture** — guardrails, grounding, and human oversight built into system design, not added after
- **Regulatory compliance** — ECOA, EU AI Act, FCRA, GDPR applied to real system decisions
- **Explainability & fairness** — adverse action letters, SHAP analysis, bias auditing across protected classes
- **Human-in-the-loop** — screening tools, not autonomous engines; escalation paths, not black boxes
